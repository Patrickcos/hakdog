    The bad news is that computer are black and white: if it’s not right it won’t run.
    
    The first tenet of the developer mindset is cultivating the zen of coding: you have to learn to be calm, break your problem into the smallest steps possible, and methodically go through your scripts line by line to root out the bug.
    
    Most importantly, you can’t give up until it’s done.
    
    Now that I have been programming for a few years I can tell you that when I encounter a problem in my code that’s not easy to diagnose, the shift is literal. I will shift all of my energy to focus on the task at hand, oftentimes literally changing how I sit in my chair, straightening my back, planting both feet on the ground, ready to tackle whatever comes at me.</p>
